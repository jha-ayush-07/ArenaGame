Arena Game was a project designed to show off how certain things are done in Forge Remastered, showcased as a fully featured game since I figured that's the best way to example stuff. \


#### Bugs
There are few minor bugs in the project.



# Usage

ArenaGame is made Unity 2018.2.3f1 using Forge 24.2.
It should work on other Unity installations, try it out.
Just open up the project in Unity, open the /Scenes/MainMenu and press play, and you are good to go.
If you want to build it, make sure you make the main menu the first scene and the ArenaScene the second scene in the build menu.
